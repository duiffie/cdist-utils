This is a small collection of scripts I use in combination with cdist to make my
life a bit easier :)

++ Setup

The scripts assume some settings that need to be available in order to function
properly. I set them in the cdist user's environment.

CDISTINSTALL=path_to_cdist_install

The directory where cdist is installed.

++ runcdist

++ cdist-upgrade
